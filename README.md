In this task, we built a Python project that fetches real-time weather forecast data from a public API and displays it visually using graphs. The main objective of the task is to understand how APIs work and how we can collect useful data from the internet to build practical applications. We used a free service called WeatherAPI, which provides weather forecast information for different cities around the world. To access this data, we first had to create a free account on weatherapi.com and generate an API key. This API key is like a password that allows our program to connect to the WeatherAPI service. Once we had the key, we created a special URL that included the city name and number of forecast days we wanted. We used the Python requests library to send a GET request to this URL and receive the data in JSON format. JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a common way of sending structured data over the internet. After receiving the data, we extracted the required information such as dates and average daily temperatures from the JSON structure. These values were stored in two separate lists so they could be used to create a visual graph. To plot the graph, we used popular Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn. The graph showed how the temperature would change over the next five days for the selected city. This made the data easier to understand and more meaningful to the user. We also included labels, a title, and color formatting to make the chart look more attractive. In addition to the basic functionality, we improved the program by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter, which is a built-in Python library for building simple desktop applications. The GUI allowed users to enter a city name in a text box and click a button to see the temperature forecast chart for that city. If the city name was incorrect or the API key was invalid, we added error messages to help users understand what went wrong. This made the application more user-friendly and professional. By completing this task, we learned many useful skills such as how to work with APIs, how to parse and process JSON data, how to visualize data using graphs, and how to design a basic GUI. We also saw how Python can be used to connect to online services and create real-world applications that are both interactive and informative. This project is similar to the kind of functionality seen in many mobile weather apps or websites where users search for their city and see a weather forecast. It showed us how important APIs are in modern applications and how powerful Python can be when combined with data visualization tools. Overall, this task helped improve our understanding of programming, data handling, user input, and graphical presentation in a very practical way. It is a perfect starting point for anyone interested in web development, data science, or application building using Python.
